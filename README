# Simple HTTP Server in C

This is a simple HTTP server implemented in C that serves static files to clients over HTTP.

-> Usage

1. Compile the server code:


gcc server.c -o server


2. Run the server:


./server


By default, the server listens on port 8080 and serves files from the `/home/xanmoy/Workspace/tinx/` directory.

3. Access files using a web browser or a tool like cURL:


curl http://localhost:8080/index.html


-> Project Structure

- `server.c`: Contains the source code for the HTTP server.
- `README.txt`: This file, providing instructions and information about the project.

-> Requirements

- C compiler (e.g., GCC)
- Linux environment (the code may require modifications to run on other platforms)

## Troubleshooting

- If the server fails to bind to the port, ensure that the port is not already in use by another application.
- If the server fails to serve files, double-check the file paths and permissions.
